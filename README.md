# Hi there, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I'm a passionate coder and developer who loves creating apps, designing websites, and diving into various coding projects. Let me share a bit about my coding journey with you!

## My Coding Journey

🛒 **Starting with Shopify**: My coding journey began when I couldn't find sections or features I needed for my projects. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and started coding with Shopify to customize and build the functionalities I desired.

📚 **Continuous Learning**: After completing coding courses through Coursera, I was eager to put my skills into practice.

🌐 **Exploring Coding Languages**: Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work with a myriad of coding languages. Among the hundreds of options, React has become my absolute favorite due to its versatility and efficiency.

## My Background

💻 **Early Fascination with Computers**: My interest in computers started at a young age when I would hover over my dad's disassembled desktops. One of the first lessons I learned was to keep magnets away from the hard drives (my dad wasn't too excited
about me rubbing a magnetic screwdriver around all the metal components, but I was excited—I didn't know screwdrivers could be magnetic!). Over time, I realized that the old magnet lesson wasn't as bad as my dad thought.

🎨 **Artistic Side**: In my free time, I love exploring my artistic side. Whether it's painting, engaging in tarantula taxidermy (yes, you read that right), or investing in amethysts to create one-of-a-kind desktop setups, I enjoy creative endeavors that
complement my coding passion.

🎮 **Gaming Enthusiast**: I'm also an open-world gaming enthusiast. I can log hundreds of hours in immersive gaming experiences without ever wanting to step away from the keyboard. If you're a fellow gamer, let's connect and exchange gaming stories and strategies!

🚴 **Outdoor Adventures**: When I'm not coding or gaming, you can find me enjoying outdoor adventures with my boyfriend. We love biking, hiking the Arizona foothills, and rock hounding for precious gems and minerals. It's a great way to recharge and find inspiration 
for my coding projects.

## My Work and Personal Projects

🏢 **Professional Projects**: After completing my Coursera courses, I started applying my coding skills to work on various projects. This includes creating web pages, developing apps to track my medical appointments and results, brainstorming exciting Android 
games, and finding innovative solutions in my role as a website administrator.


## My Approach

🚀 **Can-Do Attitude**: I'm always of the mindset that "I could probably do that!" Whether it's solving a complex problem or starting a new project, I enjoy taking on challenges and pushing my coding skills to the limit.

📖 **Lifelong Learning**: I believe that as long as I'm learning, I'm on the right path. The world of coding is constantly evolving, and I'm excited to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and techniques.
